<b>Thrust Vector Controlled - Vertical Take-off and Landing UAV unit.</b>

Project aimed at autonomous stabilization of the flight and orientation, occurring during the vertical take-off
and landing. 

*STM based 32 bit micro-controller is used as a flight control unit(FPU).

*FPU interfaces all the sensors, actuates various control surfaces. (Avionics).

**This is a on going project.
